# My-music
what it says

see [my page](http://francois.sidoroff.free.fr/Math&Music.html) for my first java attempts and my [SoundSynth](http://francois.sidoroff.free.fr/SoundSynth.html) software
(Pour les francophones le fichier fran√ßais SoundSynth.pdf est plus complet)
Comments are welcome.
My initial intention was to extend it in different directions, for instance in 
* a minimal sequencer
* an exercise generator see [for instance](http://francois.sidoroff.free.fr/abcjsExo.php)( it worked once ....)
But java and php probably are not the best language. 
The MOOC *Learn to Code Electronic Music Tools with Javascript* (https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/electronic-music-tools/) gave me the impulse I needed

So here we are today
