# The Diatonic Keyboard project
## What is this?
**_keyboard_** That's explicit: you'll play a melody using teh keyboard

**_diatonic_** in the sense that it will only play in a prescribed mode ( without accidentals)

Pretty basic, I agree
## So what?
The idea in fact is to be able to choose the **mode** (the scale) and the **temperament**
cf (Physics of Music Notes)[http://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/Physicsofmusic.html]

## How does it work?
You need the 3 files cdiato.html, cdiato.css and solfege.js and you play using the upper letter row of your computer 
( A--P, Azerty keyboard but a qwerty version is easily modified)

## Present state
Presently are only implemented the standard major scale (ionian mode ) and equal temperament, but everything is ready for extension

## Further development 
Adding a drone and/or a "left hand" keyboard playing some chords
